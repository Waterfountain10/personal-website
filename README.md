# William Kiem Lafond - Personal Website

Inspired this website is a digital canvas showcasing my projects, experiences, and a bit about myself, all wrapped in a theme inspired by the nostalgic era of old computer systems.


## Built with Angular CLI

This project is powered by Angular CLI and it is deployed with Netlify. I used a little bit of Adobe Illustrator for most svg files or found them online/bootstrapped.


## Future improvements

In the future, I do want to add a publications sections related to research papers or any published works/blogs/writings.
Also, the style could definetely be better, but for now it works, and it is not in my priority as of this moment (which is why this is V1)
