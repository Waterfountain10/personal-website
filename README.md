# [Your Name] - Personal Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website. This site is a digital canvas showcasing my projects, experiences, and a bit about myself, all wrapped in a theme inspired by the nostalgic era of old Korean arcade games and computers.

## Website Theme

The aesthetic of this site draws heavily from the visual lexicon of the Korean digital renaissance period. The interface emulates the look and feel of vintage computer systems and arcade cabinets, complete with pixelated fonts, vibrant color schemes, and interactive elements reminiscent of the gaming culture of yesteryears.

## Built with Angular CLI

This project is powered by Angular CLI, chosen for its robust framework that allows for a dynamic and responsive single-page application. Angular's modularity and ease of maintenance make it the perfect choice for a personal portfolio that is both performant and scalable.

## Logo and Branding

True to the theme, the logo of this portfolio is a custom creation designed in Adobe Illustrator. It's a modern interpretation of the classic 8-bit art style, symbolizing the blend of old-school inspiration with contemporary design practices.
